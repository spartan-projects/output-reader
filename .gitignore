### JENKINS_HOME template
# Learn more about Jenkins and JENKINS_HOME directory for which this file is
# intended.
#
#  http://jenkins-ci.org/
#  https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Administering+Jenkins
#
# Note: secret.key is purposefully not tracked by git. This should be backed up
# separately because configs may contain secrets which were encrypted using the
# secret.key.  To back up secrets use 'tar -czf /tmp/secrets.tgz secret*' and
# save the file separate from your repository.  If you want secrets backed up
# with configuration, then see the bottom of this file for an example.

# Ignore all JENKINS_HOME except jobs directory, root xml config, and
# .gitignore file.
/*
!/jobs
!/.gitignore
!/*.xml

# Ignore all files in jobs subdirectories except for folders.
# Note: git doesn't track folders, only file content.
jobs/**
!jobs/**/

# Uncomment the following line to save next build numbers with config.

#!jobs/**/nextBuildNumber

# For performance reasons, we want to ignore builds in Jenkins jobs because it
# contains many tiny files on large installations.  This can impact git
# performance when running even basic commands like 'git status'.
builds
indexing

# Exclude only config.xml files in repository subdirectories.
!config.xml

# Don't track workspaces (when users build on the master).
jobs/**/*workspace

# Security warning: If secrets are included with your configuration, then an
# adversary will be able to decrypt all encrypted secrets within Jenkins
# config.  Including secrets is a bad practice, but the example is included in
# case someone still wants it for convenience.  Uncomment the following line to
# include secrets for decryption with repository configuration in Git.

#!/secret*

# As a result, only Jenkins settings and job config.xml files in JENKINS_HOME
# will be tracked by git.
